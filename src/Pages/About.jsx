                The Ministry of Environment provides guidance, technical
                assistance, and financial support to various stakeholders, such
                as state governments, local bodies, civil society organizations,

                Some of our key focus areas are biodiversity conservation,
                climate change mitigation and adaptation, waste management and
                recycling, environmental education and awareness, and
                international cooperation.

              <p className="mt-2 text-left space-y-3">
                The Ministry of Environment was founded in 1985 as the
                Department of Environment under the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office. In
                1992, it was renamed as the Ministry of Environment and Forests.
                In 2014, it was restructured as the Ministry of Environment,
                Forests and Climate Change. In 2021, it was further reorganized
                as the Ministry of Environment with a focus on e-waste
                management and recycling. Some of our notable achievements
                include launching the National Action Plan on Climate Change in
                2008, hosting the Conference of Parties (COP) 14 of the United
                Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in 2019,
                and initiating the E-Waste Facility Locator project in 2023.

              <p className="mt-2 text-left">
                This website is a part of the E-Waste Facility Locator project,
                which is an initiative of the Ministry of Environment to promote
                e-waste management and recycling in India. We aim to provide a
                convenient and user-friendly platform for users to find the
                nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility in their area.
                We also offer educational pop-ups that inform users about the
                harmful components of their e-waste and their effects on the
                environment and human health if not disposed correctly. We also
                reward users for disposing their e-waste correctly by giving
                them credit points relative to the value of the precious metals
                recovered from their old devices, which they can redeem for
                coupons, vouchers, or donations to environmental causes. The
                website is designed and developed by a team of students, who
                participated in the Smart India Hackathon 2023, a nationwide
                competition organized by the Ministry of Education and the All
                India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to solve various
                problems faced by different ministries and departments of the
                Government of India.
